# Tic_Tac_Toe-Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does.

This implementation of Tic Tac Toe is designed for both beginner and intermediate developers to practice concepts such as:

#How to Play-

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is assigned the symbol 'X', and Player 2 is assigned the symbol 'O'.
3. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell of the grid.
4. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins.
5. If all 9 spaces are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a tie.
6. A replay option is available after each round.
7. In Case of Winning , the Firecracker sound will be played for 2 second.
8. The message appears for both Winning and Tying the Game and will automatically disappear after a few seconds.
